# Leetcode

Working my way through Leetcode to expand my knowledge while prepping for technical interviews. 

Sometimes I'm working through curated lists, such as [NeetCode](https://github.com/bytesbybianca/leetcode/blob/main/NEETCODE.md), [Grind 75](https://github.com/bytesbybianca/leetcode/blob/main/GRIND75.md), or [30 Days of LC JavaScript Challenge](https://github.com/bytesbybianca/leetcode/blob/main/LC-30DAYS-JS.md). Other times, I'm freestyling!

ðŸ”¸ Each .js file represents one challenge solved

ðŸ”¸ Each file contains the title, link, instructions, my solution, and test cases of the challenge
