# Leetcode

Working my way through Leetcode to expand my knowledge while prepping for technical interviews. 

Sometimes I'm working through curated lists, such as [NeetCode](https://github.com/bytesbybianca/leetcode/blob/main/NEETCODE.md) or [Grind 75](https://github.com/bytesbybianca/leetcode/blob/main/GRIND75.md). Other times, I'm freestyling!
